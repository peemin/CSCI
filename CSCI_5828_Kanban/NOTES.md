**What is Kanban:**

A framework to manage knowlege base work, such as software development, with an emphisis on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members.  

The name ‘Kanban’ comes from the Japanese symbol かんばん - which rougthly translates to signboard or Billboard.

**Origins of Kanban:**

In the early 1950s, Ohno observed how customers only picked up the number of items they needed from the grocery store. In turn, the supermarket replenished the supply — at the right time and in the required amounts. This got Ohno thinking about how to eliminate waste on the production line.

Back then, parts moved to the next stage as soon as they were completed. Employees didn't communicate with each other about their needs. However, Ohno realized it would be more efficient if an employee in the later stage of the process informed a worker in the previous phase how many parts he needed and when. With Ohno's "supermarket formula," only enough parts were produced in the former phases to replace what was used in the next.

At first, parts shortages and line stoppages happened frequently, because floor employees weren't used to the method. Yet, Ohno didn't worry. He emphasized the importance of locating the cause each time a problem occurred. It then became clear to the person in charge of each stage that there was an urgent need to adjust the production speed and improve the process.

The Kanban System, later established in all Toyota factories, helped to ease Ohno's philosophy into a working practice. Under this setup, employees created signboards, or kanban, to transfer information between processes, such as the number of parts that had to be filled. The Kanban System eventually helped the production flow function more smoothly, a fact reflected in quality and productivity. Kanban took on many forms as part of the Just-in-Time System. In the end, pointing out errors and providing countermeasures became key to achieving kaizen (continuous improvement) in all the activity areas — from production to sales and marketing.

The Goal was to develop a process that would:
1. Maximize customer value while minimizing waste
2. Improve the production process continously
3. Bring out the best from the people.

Supermarket analogy:
1. At any given time, the supermarket only stocks only what it expects to sell
2. Since future supply is assured, the customer retrieve only the item needed at the required time
3. This then causes the store to restock.
4. In supermarkets, signboards are used to guide the "shopping" processes to specific locations within the store


**What is just in time delivery?**

The nature of just-in-time, meaning JIT manufacturing/production or JIT in any other setting, may be reduced to four somewhat differently stated views.

1. Many have said that JIT revolves around wastes: "At its core, JIT is a waste-elimination philosophy . . . ." Among the earliest writings on the matter, Shingo lists, as the "7 wastes," the wastes of: over-production, waiting, transportation, processing itself, stocks [inventories], motion, and making defective products.
2. Others have equated JIT production with kanban. For example, one book has both kanban and just-in-time in its main title.
3. Still others assert that JIT's main aim is elimination of inventories, although Murray maintains that "JIT is defined as 'NOT an inventory control system—but a way of thinking, working and management to eliminate wastes in the manufacturing process'.[28] In keeping with that view, JIT manufacturing has often been referred to in contrast to the more conventional just-in-case (JIC) mode: JIC keeps extra inventories to be used in case of disruptions (e.g., scrap, rework, equipment breakdowns, late deliveries), whereas JIT continually reduces such inventory buffers by continually attacking causes of disruptions.[29][need quotation to verify] Zero Inventories is the title of a 1983 book by Hall,[30] but the book actually does not suggest that JIT is mainly about inventory; rather the book features quick setup, cells (group technology), kanban, and so on, and zero inventory is posed only as an unattainable ideal, one that is easy to see and count
4. The fourth view is that JIT is mainly about quick response, relating to the "T"—for "time"—in JIT. As Blackburn put it, "Quick response is one of the major benefits of JIT. Time or speed is the linchpin of this manufacturing philosophy. Inventory, on the other hand, is an ancillary benefit."[31] Quick response refers alternatively to reduction of cycle times,[32] flow times, throughput times, and, all the way to the customer, lead times: "JIT," according to Bicheno, has the "provocative goal," of producing "instantaneously, with perfect quality and minimum waste," and he goes on to qualify "instantaneously" by saying, "The ideal way to produce the end product is literally just in time to meet the market demand for it. Thus, JIT is primarily a lead-time reduction programme."[33]

A methodology aimed primarily at reducing flow times within production as well as response times from suppliers and to customers

**Kanban Process:**
* Kanban is rooted in four basic principles:
  * Start with existing process
    * The Kanban method does not prescribe a specific set of roles or process steps. The Kanban method starts with existing roles and processes and stimulates continuous, incremental and evolutionary changes to the system. The Kanban method is a change management method[citation needed].
  * Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
    * The organization (or team) must agree that continuous, incremental and evolutionary change is the way to make system improvements and make them stick. Sweeping changes may seem more effective but have a higher failure rate due to resistance and fear in the organization. The Kanban method encourages continuous small incremental and evolutionary changes to your current system.
  * Respect the current process, roles, responsibilities and titles
    * It is likely that the organization currently has some elements that work acceptably and are worth preserving. The Kanban method seeks to drive out fear in order to facilitate future change. It attempts to eliminate initial fears by agreeing to respect current roles, responsibilities and job titles with the goal of gaining broader support.
  * Leadership at all levels
    * Acts of leadership at all levels in the organization, from individual contributors to senior management, are encouraged.

**Kanban in the context of software development**
Kanban in the context of software development can mean a visual process-management system that tells what to produce, when to produce it, and how much to produce

Formulated by David Anderson, the Kanban Method is as an approach to incremental, evolutionary process and systems change for organizations. It uses a work-in-progress limited pull system as the core mechanism to expose system operation (or process) problems and stimulate collaboration to continuously improve the system. Visualisation is an important aspect of Kanban as it allows to understand the work and the workflow

Kanban's core principles are the same in industries like software development and human resource management as they are in manufacturing: visualize your work, limit your work in process, focus on flow, and practice continuous improvement.

**Kanban Cards**
Similar to agile story cards, Kanban cards are a key component of Kanban.  
They are use to signal the need to move materials (stories) with in the production process.  

There is a belief held that demand-driven systems lead to faster turnarounds in production and lower inventory levels, helping companies implementing such systems be more competitive.

**Kanban Board**
A kanban board is one of the tools which can be used to implement the kanban method for a project.

Kanban boards are perceived as a variation on traditional kanban cards. Instead of the signal cards that represent demand or capacity, the board utilizes magnets, plastic chips, colored washers or sticky notes to represent work items.  Each of these objects represents an item in a production process as it moves around the board. Its movement corresponds with a process.  At its simplest, the board is usually divided into three sections: "To do", "In Progress" and "Done". Complex Kanban boards can be created that visualise the flow of work across development process. Employees move cards to the section on the board that coincides with the receptacle it represents.

The most popular example of kanban board for agile or lean software development consists of: Backlog, Ready, Coding, Testing, Approval and Done columns. It is also a common practice to name columns in a different way, for example: Next, In Development, Done, Customer Acceptance, Live

With kanban boards, you can:

Visually see work in progress
1. Instantly understand impediments (things causing you to delay) and take steps to remove them
2. Improve communication between yourself and others on your team
3. Empower teams to self-manage visual processes and work flows
4. Inspire team collaboration
