** Introduction**
R is a programming language and software environment used mostly for statistical computing and graphic development 
by statisticians and data miners.

1. R grew out of the S programming language with lexical scoping semantics.  
   S was created by John Chambers while at Bell Labs
2. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand in 1993 
3. R is named partly after the first names original R authors and partly as a play on the name of S.
4. R is a open source GNU project
5. With the increasing amount of data collection in our daily lives, R's popularity has skyrocketed since the late 2000's.

**Statistical features**
R programming language can be used to implement a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques
1. linear and nonlinear modeling, 
2. classical statistical tests, 
3. time-series analysis, classification, 
4. clustering
5. and others. 

**R Programming Language**
1. The source code for the R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R
2. Many of R's standard functions are written in R itself, 
3. For computationally intensive tasks, R scripts can call C, C++, and Fortran code at run time. 
4. Advanced users can write C, C++, Java, .NET or Python code to manipulate R objects directly.
5. R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format
6. Another strength of R is that it can be used to produce publication-quality graphs, including mathematical symbols. 
7. R is an interpreted language; users typically access it through a command-line interpreter
8. Due to its S heritage, R is also an object oriented langauge.
